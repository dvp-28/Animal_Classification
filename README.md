# Animal_Classification
This project aims to build a deep learning model that can classify images of 15 different animals using convolutional neural networks (CNN). 
The dataset consists of labeled folders with images resized to 224×224×3 dimensions.
The model is trained and evaluated to predict animals like Cat, Dog, Tiger, Elephant, Zebra, and more.
